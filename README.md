ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John, an automation QA engineer with a passion for technology and continuous improvement. Over the years, I've honed my skills in quality assurance, ensuring that software products meet the highest standards of functionality and performance.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing my skills to shift into a data engineering role. Data engineering fascinates me because of its critical role in enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions. Iâ€™m eager to explore this field further, leveraging my existing technical expertise to design and manage data systems that provide reliable and efficient data access.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working in Python and I am learning SQL. Python has been my go-to language for automating test processes and scripting, and Iâ€™m now expanding my knowledge to include data manipulation and analysis. Iâ€™m excited to combine these skills to develop robust data pipelines and contribute to data-driven projects.
